{"name":"Streamsx.sparkmllib","tagline":"Toolkit for real-time scoring using Apache Spark's machine learning library","body":"### Overview\r\nApache Spark is a fast general purpose clustering system. By allowing user's programs to load data into the cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, it is well suited for machine learning algorithms. MLlib is a machine learning library provided by Spark with support for common machine learning algorithms including classification, regression, collaborative filtering and others. The purpose of this project is to allow Spark's MLlib library to be used for real-time scoring of data in InfoSphere Streams.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to get started, refer to the  [Getting Started guide](gettingstarted.html)\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the toolkit is available [here](com.ibm.streamsx.messaging/doc/spldoc/html/index.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
